			<h1>You are logged in!</h1>
			<p>This app used the meteor package <a href="https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router">iron:router</a> to create a "route controller" for this route. Before you arrived on this page, iron:router checked to see if you were logged in; if you were then you got here no problem, but if you weren't you had to create an account or log in.</p>
